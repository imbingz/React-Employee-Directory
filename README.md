  ## Project Objective
  * To create an employee directory with React using UI components, managing component state, and responding to user events.
  * Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 
  * The user should be able to:
      * Sort the table by at least one category
      * Filter the users by at least one property.
  * Use HTML5 syntax such as <Header> <Main> <Section> with React
  
  ## User Story
  * As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
  * An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
